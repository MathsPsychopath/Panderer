# Panderer

## What is this?

Another WIP, but suppose you have an audience and want to get a consensus real time so you can pander and make your viewer ratings go up. Look no further than Panderer, where you receive a real time monitor of how your viewers feel about you.

## How it works

1. Viewers receive a link to go a page where the have the option of either Thumbs Up or Thumbs Down
2. Viewers' votes will be pooled together and directed to the broadcaster as data for their real time monitor
3. If the broadcaster does something positive, ratings go up. Otherwise, ratings tank.
